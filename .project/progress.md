### Critical Issue Resolution: Authentication System Restored (January 12, 2026) ✅
- **[INFRA-011] Broken /login Route** ✅ **COMPLETED - APPLICATION FULLY RESTORED**
  - **Problem Solved**: /login route now returns HTTP 200, users can authenticate successfully
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Incomplete Blueprint migration caused @app.route decorators to fail during app import
  - **Solution Implemented**: Manual route registration system in app/factory.py using add_url_rule()
  - **Technical Approach**:
    - Modified factory.py to manually register 12 legacy route functions
    - Commented out failing @app.route decorators in routes.py
    - Fixed Bootstrap double-initialization conflict
    - Created users table manually for immediate functionality
    - Resolved macOS PostgreSQL service conflict on port 5432
  - **Validation Results**:
    - ✅ All 21 routes properly registered and accessible
    - ✅ Flask application starts without errors
    - ✅ Database connection functional
    - ✅ Authentication flow fully restored
    - ✅ Backwards database compatibility maintained (critical requirement)
