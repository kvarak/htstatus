📊 **Current State**: 100+ Tasks Complete • ALL P0 Critical Bugs Complete ✅ • Quality Gates 23/26 Passing ✅ • P1 CUSTOM CHPP PRODUCTION COMPLETE ✅ • P2 SIMPLIFICATION ACTIVE 🎯

> **Current Status**: P0 CRITICAL BUGS COMPLETE ✅ + BACKLOG CLEANED ✅ - All completed P2 tasks (UI-012, REFACTOR-022, REFACTOR-030) moved to history/backlog-done.md with completion documentation. P2 active tasks reduced from 5 to 2: REFACTOR-021 (Legacy CHPP cleanup 30min) and REFACTOR-027 (Startup logic 15min). Quality gates maintained at 23/26. Repository hygiene improved through systematic task completion tracking. Enhanced version system and branding consistency complete. (January 27, 2026)
