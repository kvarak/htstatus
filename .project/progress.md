## Current Architecture & Strategic Position

### ✅ BUG-001 Player Display Issue Resolution (2026-01-22)
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Restored core player list functionality after 57-commit debugging journey
- **Root Cause**: Team data fetched using user ID (182085) instead of team ID - users can own multiple teams
- **Solution**: Changed `session['all_teams'] = [existing_user.ht_id]` to `session['all_teams'] = current_user._teams_ht_id`
- **Investigation Journey**: 57 commits spanning library downgrades, XML inspection, template debugging, skill parsing analysis
- **Library Decisions**: Downgraded to stable versions (pychpp 0.3.12, Flask 2.3.3, werkzeug 2.3.8) after issues with 0.5.10/3.1+
- **User Validation**: "ok, now my players are showing up properly, phew!" - team 9838 data displays correctly
- **Remaining Work**: CLEANUP-001 to remove debug code (B108 security issue, temp files, debug logging)
- **Status**: Player display fully functional, unblocked BUG-002/003/004 investigation

### ✅ Quality Intelligence Platform Security Enhancement (2026-01-22)
**Impact**: Improved security reporting clarity - separates CVE vulnerabilities from code security issues
- **Problem**: Original reporting showed "0 VULNERABILITIES" despite B108 Bandit code issue (misleading)
- **Solution**: Split security metric into two distinct categories:
  - **CVE Vulnerabilities**: Dependency security issues from Safety scan (currently 0)
  - **Code Security**: Code-level issues from Bandit scan (currently 1 - B108 temp file)
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Updated Makefile security target to run Bandit and Safety separately with JSON output
  - Enhanced quality-intelligence.sh to parse and report both metrics independently
  - Added separate temp files (/tmp/bandit-results.json, /tmp/safety-results.json)
- **Reporting**: Quality gates now clearly distinguish "CVE Vulnerabilities: ✅ NONE" from "Code Security: ⚠️ 1 ISSUE(S)"
- **Status**: Eliminates confusion about security status, improves transparency

### ✅ P1 Testing Infrastructure Completion (2026-01-22)
**Impact**: TEST-012 COMPLETE - Split test suite architecture achieving 97% isolation effectiveness
- **Problem Solved**: Cross-module fixture contamination causing 31 test failures when run together (tests passed individually)
- **Solution Implemented**: Split into 3 isolated test groups with nested savepoint pattern
- **Results**: Group 1 (54 tests) 100%, Group 2 (35 tests) 100%, Group 3 (98/104 tests) 94%
- **Technical Achievement**: Eliminated 25 cross-contamination failures, enhanced Makefile with isolated test targets
- **Remaining Work**: 6 player group fixture issues moved to TEST-012-A (PostgreSQL foreign key constraints)

### ✅ Core Functionality Restoration (2026-01-22)
**Impact**: All P0 critical bugs resolved - BUG-001, BUG-002, BUG-003, BUG-004, CLEANUP-001
- **Player Display Fixed**: Team data fetching using correct team ID vs user ID (57-commit debug journey)
- **Training Page Restored**: Library ecosystem stability achieved with pychpp 0.3.12, Flask 2.3.3, werkzeug 2.3.8
- **Player Groups Functional**: User confirmed "works" - groups now integrated into player management workflows
- **Debug Page Operational**: Administrative visibility into player data changes restored
- **Security Issues Resolved**: B108 temp file usage eliminated via CLEANUP-001
