# Project Goals

**Vision**: Simple, reliable Hattrick team management tool for game enthusiasts and data geeks

**Project Nature**: This is a **hobby project** focused on simplicity and reliability over enterprise features. Built by Hattrick fans, for Hattrick fans who love diving deep into team statistics and player development.

## Core Objectives
1. **Database Protection**: Maximum safeguards for production data integrity (critical priority)
2. **Simple Functionality**: Focus on core features that Hattrick geeks actually use
3. **Data Insights**: Clear analysis for player development and team optimization
4. **Hobby-Friendly Development**: Keep complexity reasonable for spare-time maintenance
5. **Hattrick Integration**: Reliable CHPP API usage respecting rate limits

## Success Metrics

- **User Satisfaction**: Hattrick managers find value in player analysis
- **Stability**: Features work reliably without constant maintenance
- **Simplicity**: New features don't add excessive complexity
- **Community**: Positive feedback from Hattrick community

## Development Philosophy

### Hobby Project Principles
- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid over-engineering for enterprise scenarios
- **Database First**: All changes must prioritize data integrity
- **Hattrick-Centric**: Features should enhance actual Hattrick gameplay
- **Sustainable Effort**: Maintenance burden should remain manageable

### Database Protection Standards
- **Mandatory Migrations**: All schema changes use tested migration scripts
- **Backup Validation**: Production data backups tested regularly
- **Model Safety**: SQLAlchemy patterns prevent data corruption
- **Change Review**: Database modifications require extra validation

### Future Possibilities (Low Priority)
- Enhanced player comparison tools for transfer decisions
- Simple training optimization suggestions
- Basic league statistics for friendly competition
- Mobile-friendly interface improvements

*Note: Future features only considered if they maintain simplicity and don't compromise database safety.*
