**Problem Statement** (Feature request from June 2020):
The player table currently supports sorting but lacks filtering capabilities. Users need to be able to filter players by multiple criteria (skill levels, age, status, group, position) to:
- Quickly find players matching specific criteria
- Identify potential lineup candidates based on skill thresholds
- Discover training opportunities and development gaps
- Manage and organize players more efficiently across groups
- Plan tactics and formations based on available skill pools

**Implementation**:
1. **Filter Controls** (1.5-2 hours):
   - Add filter bar above player table with multiple filter options
   - Filters: Skill ranges (keeper, defender, playmaker, etc.), Age range, Status, Group, Position
   - Searchable dropdowns for group and position selection
   - Range sliders for skill levels and age
   - "Reset Filters" button to clear all selections

2. **Filter Logic** (1-1.5 hours):
   - Implement client-side filtering for instant feedback
   - Support multiple simultaneous filters (AND logic)
   - Preserve sort order when filtering applied
   - Display count of filtered results vs total players

3. **State Management** (0.5-1 hour):
   - Store filter state in URL query parameters for bookmarkable searches
   - Persist filter preferences in localStorage (optional)
   - Handle filter updates efficiently

4. **UI/UX Polish** (1-1.5 hours):
   - Visual indication of active filters
   - Clear filter badge showing count of active criteria
   - Responsive design for mobile/tablet
   - Accessibility: ARIA labels for filter controls

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Filter controls appear above player table with intuitive UI
- Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- Results update instantly as filters change
- Filtered count displayed (e.g., "Showing 12 of 23 players")
- Sort order persists when filters applied
- Reset filters button works correctly
- Filter state preserved in URL for sharing/bookmarking
- Mobile-responsive design maintained
- All filter types work correctly (skills, age, status, group, position)

**Filter Types Supported**:
- **Skill Ranges**: Separate sliders for each of 7 core skills (0-20 scale)
- **Age Range**: Min/max age selector
- **Status**: Dropdown (Active, Injured, Sold, etc.)
- **Group**: Multi-select from user-defined groups
- **Position**: Multi-select from field positions
- **Search**: Text search on player name/number

**Expected Outcomes**: Faster player discovery, easier tactical planning, improved team management workflow

### [UI-006] Transfer Bid Display
**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 2-3 hours | **Impact**: Transfer market visibility
**Dependencies**: CHPP API (pychpp 0.2.11+, completed) | **Strategic Value**: Real-time transfer information

**Problem Statement** (Feature request from June 2020):
Users need to see current bids on players they've listed for transfer/sale directly in the player table. Currently, they must:
- Navigate to transfer market separately
- Find their listed players manually
- Check bids elsewhere in the interface

A new column showing current bids would allow users to:
- Monitor transfer activity at a glance
- Make quick decisions about bid acceptance
- Track selling opportunities in the player management view
- Improve transfer workflow efficiency

**Historical Context**:
- Requested June 23, 2020 (GitHub issue #27)
- Required additional CHPP API data that wasn't available
- Blocked until pychpp 0.2.11 fix was released (January 13, 2021)
- Now unblocked and ready to implement

**Implementation**:
1. **Backend API Integration** (0.5-1 hour):
   - Add transfer/bid data retrieval from CHPP API (pychpp 0.2.11+)
   - Fetch current bids for players listed for sale
   - Cache bid data with appropriate TTL (e.g., 10-15 minutes)
   - Handle players not on market gracefully (null/empty display)

2. **Data Processing** (0.5 hour):
   - Match player IDs to transfer listings
   - Extract current bid amount and bidding team
   - Format bid information for display
   - Handle multiple bids/countries

3. **UI Implementation** (1-1.5 hours):
   - Add "Current Bid" column to player table
   - Display bid amount and team name (if available)
   - Show "Not listed" or empty for players without active bids
   - Add tooltip with bid details (amount, bidding team, deadline)
   - Sort capability on bid column

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Current Bid" column appears in player table (optional column, can be toggled)
- Shows bid amount for players listed for transfer
- Displays bidding team name when available
- Shows "Not listed" or empty for players not on market
- Bid data updates with API calls
- Column sortable by bid amount
- Mobile-responsive design maintained
- No performance degradation

**UI Considerations**:
- Column position: Near the end of table (after group, before actions)
- Display format: Currency amount + team name (e.g., "€150,000 - Hamburg")
- Conditional formatting: Highlight rows with active bids?
- Refresh: Auto-update when transfer data is fetched

**Technical Notes**:
- Requires pychpp 0.2.11+ (already available as of January 2021)
- CHPP transfer data only reflects bids from public transfer market
- Bid data may have slight delay from Hattrick interface

**Expected Outcomes**: Improved transfer market visibility, faster decision-making for selling players, better integration of transfer activities

### [UI-007] Update Report Icon Display
**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 2-3 hours | **Impact**: Change visualization and readability
**Dependencies**: Update/change report UI (completed) | **Strategic Value**: Better visual communication of important changes

**Problem Statement** (Feature request from June 2020, GitHub issue #37):
The update/change report currently displays player changes as text (e.g., "cards 1->0", "injury band-aid"). Users need visual icon-based representation to:
- Quickly identify critical changes (red cards, injuries)
- Reduce text clutter in change reports
- Visually highlight the most important changes
- Make important stats/changes more prominent

**Historical Context**:
- Requested June 28, 2020
- Partially implemented in January 2021 (commit 6cbfcf7)
- Current implementation shows icons for red cards and injuries
- Enhancement requested: Make important changes bold/larger, improve visual hierarchy

**Implementation**:
1. **Icon Display** (0.5-1 hour):
   - Display red card icon instead of text (🟥 or red card icon)
   - Display injury icon instead of text (⚕️ or band-aid icon)
   - Only show red cards (not yellow), only show real injuries (not band-aids)
   - Use consistent icon set throughout application

2. **Visual Hierarchy** (1-1.5 hours):
   - Make main stat changes bold or larger font
   - Highlight trained/developed skills with emphasis
   - Differentiate critical changes (red card, injury) from minor changes
   - Use color coding for different change types
   - Add visual spacing and grouping for readability

3. **UI Refinement** (0.5 hour):
   - Ensure icons are accessible (alt text, tooltips)
   - Maintain responsive design
   - Test readability across device sizes
   - Ensure icons are color-blind friendly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Red card changes display with icon (not text)
- Injury changes display with icon (not text)
- Yellow cards NOT shown as icons (red cards only)
- Band-aids NOT shown as icons (injuries only)
- Main stat changes (trained) displayed bold or larger
- Important changes visually distinguished from minor ones
- Tooltips explain what each icon represents
- Mobile-responsive display maintained
- No layout breaks due to icon display

**Icon Usage**:
- **Red Card**: 🟥 or card icon (when red card given)
- **Injury**: ⚕️ or medical icon (when player injured)
- **Trained**: Bold/larger text for skill increases (main training)
- **Stats**: Regular text for minor changes

**Visual Hierarchy Examples**:
- "**Defender 14→15** ⚕️ Injured" (main change + critical status)
- "Keeper 12→13" (secondary improvement, regular text)
- "Passing 8→9 🟥 Red card" (with penalty/disciplinary info)

**Expected Outcomes**: Improved change report readability, faster identification of critical player updates, better visual communication of update data

### [FEAT-006] Default Player Groups for New Users
**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 2-3 hours | **Impact**: Onboarding and user experience
**Dependencies**: Player grouping system (completed) | **Strategic Value**: Reduced onboarding friction, improved adoption

**Problem Statement** (Feature request from Oct 16, 2023, GitHub issue #52):
New users starting with HT Status have a blank slate with no player groups, making it difficult to understand:
- What groups are and how to use them
- How to organize their squad effectively
- How to get started quickly with the application

The threshold for understanding what to do and making the interface useful is too high. Default groups would lower the barrier to entry and help new users:
- Get started immediately without confusion
- Understand the grouping system by example
- Have a structured team organization from day one
- Improve time-to-value for new users

**Implementation**:
1. **Default Group Templates** (0.5-1 hour):
   - Create sensible default groups on new user registration
   - Suggested defaults: "Formation 1", "Substitutes", "Youth", "Development", "For Sale"
   - Alternative approach: Groups based on common strategies (e.g., "Starters", "Bench", "Prospects")
   - Allow users to customize defaults in settings (future enhancement)

2. **Automatic Group Assignment** (0.5-1 hour):
   - On first team import, suggest automatic assignment of players to groups
   - Based on match role, age, or player status
   - Allow user to review and modify assignments
   - Manual override of automatic suggestions

3. **Onboarding Enhancement** (1 hour):
   - Show tooltip/hint explaining groups on first visit
   - Highlight default groups in UI
   - Link to help documentation explaining group usage
   - Optional guided tour (future enhancement)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New users automatically receive default player groups on registration
- Default groups are sensible and useful for common use cases
- Group names are clear and self-explanatory
- Users can view and modify default groups
- Users can delete default groups if desired
- Existing users unaffected (no retroactive group creation)
- Default groups appear in group dropdown/selector
- Help text explains purpose of each default group
- Mobile-responsive interface maintained

**Suggested Default Groups**:
1. **Formation 1** - Current starting lineup
2. **Formation 2** - Alternative tactics/formation
3. **Substitutes** - Backup players
4. **Youth** - Young development players
5. **Development** - Players being trained/improved
6. **For Sale** - Players listed for transfer

**Alternative Approach** (based on team size):
- Small teams (0-20 players): Simplified defaults ("Starters", "Subs", "Youth")
- Larger teams (20+ players): Full defaults with more categories

**User Customization** (Phase 2, future):
- Allow users to choose default group templates on signup
- Pre-built templates: "Competitive", "Development", "Minimal", "Advanced"
- Custom group templates created by experienced users

**Technical Implementation**:
- Create database seeding for default groups
- Trigger on first user/team registration
- Handle existing users gracefully (no changes)
- Provide admin/management option to reset to defaults

**Expected Outcomes**: Reduced onboarding friction, faster time-to-value, improved user adoption, better first-time user experience
