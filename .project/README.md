# HTStatus Development Methodology Guide

*This file provides a structured, AI-assisted development workflow for the HTStatus project.*

## Overview

This guide documents the professional development methodology for HTStatus, featuring systematic task execution, quality assurance, documentation standards, and infrastructure setup for efficient, maintainable development.

## Development Philosophy

HTStatus development follows a **structured, quality-gated methodology**:
- **Systematic Development**: Prompt-based workflows for consistent task execution
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing gates before completion
- **Documentation Integrity**: Clear separation of user, technical, and development documentation
- **Infrastructure Reliability**: Standardized development and deployment patterns

## Development Workflow

### Core Development Cycle

1. **Plan**: Analyze tasks and create an implementation strategy
2. **Execute**: Implement according to plan with quality gates
3. **Review**: Validate completeness and alignment
4. **Update**: Update project documentation and status

### AI-Assisted Development Setup

- Use VS Code with an AI assistant extension for prompt-based workflows
- Access structured prompts from `.project/prompts.json` (if present)

### Workflow Commands

- **Plan**: Analyze next development task with strategic alignment
- **Execute**: Implement planned solution with testing and documentation
- **Review**: Validate previous work against requirements
- **Update**: Update project status and planning documents
