# [DOC-024] Remove Legacy Setup Instructions

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 1 hour | **Priority**: P6 | **Impact**: Documentation clarity and setup confidence
**Dependencies**: None | **Strategic Value**: Streamlined developer onboarding

## Problem Statement
README.md contains confusing mix of legacy and current setup instructions:
- Mixing of "Modern Setup (UV + Docker Compose)" with "Legacy Setup (Deprecated)" creates confusion
- Old pipreqs/pip workflow instructions alongside UV instructions

**Current Impact**:
- New developers unsure which setup path to follow
- Legacy instructions no longer work with current codebase
- Mixing old and new patterns reduces confidence in documentation
- Extra reading burden to distinguish current vs historical

## Implementation
1. **Remove/Archive Legacy Setup Section** (20 min):
   - Delete "Legacy Setup (Deprecated)" section entirely
   - Remove pipreqs and pip install instructions
   - Keep only UV-based dependency management

2. **Clean Database Migration Instructions** (15 min):
   - Remove old `python manage.py db` commands
   - Keep only modern `make db-migrate` and `make db-upgrade` commands
   - Remove "On problems" section with deprecated stamp commands

3. **Simplify Configuration Section** (15 min):
   - Remove or significantly compress "Migration from Legacy config.py"
   - Focus on current setup: config.py.template or .env
   - Keep instructions concise and current-focused

4. **Verify Command Accuracy** (10 min):
   - Test all remaining commands work with current setup
   - Ensure no references to removed files or deprecated workflows
   - Cross-reference with Makefile help output

## Acceptance Criteria
- No "Legacy" or "Deprecated" sections remain
- All commands use UV or Make (no direct python/pip commands)
- Configuration instructions focus on current templates
- README length reduced by removing historical content
- All setup steps validated as current

## Expected Outcomes
Streamlined README that confidently guides new developers through current setup without legacy distractions
