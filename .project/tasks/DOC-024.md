# [DOC-024] Documentation Cleanup (Legacy Setup, Architecture, Historical References)

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 2-3 hours | **Priority**: P3 | **Impact**: Documentation clarity and onboarding
**Dependencies**: None | **Strategic Value**: Streamlined developer experience

## Problem Statement
Multiple documentation cleanup needs have accumulated:
1. **README.md**: Contains confusing mix of legacy and current setup instructions
2. **architecture.md**: File structure references may be outdated (DOC-025)
3. **backlog.md**: Historical references that confuse current priorities (DOC-026)
4. **General cleanup**: Legacy patterns scattered across documentation (DOC-029)

## Implementation
1. **README.md Legacy Removal** (1 hour):
   - Delete "Legacy Setup (Deprecated)" section entirely
   - Remove pipreqs and pip install instructions (keep only UV)
   - Clean database migration instructions (use only make commands)
   - Simplify configuration section (remove migration notes)
2. **architecture.md Structure Update** (30 min):
   - Update file structure references to match current codebase
   - Remove references to deprecated components
   - Ensure accuracy of blueprint and component descriptions

3. **backlog.md Historical Cleanup** (30 min):
   - Add "Historical Note:" prefix to resolved issue references
   - Remove references to "dual registration" or "route conflicts"
   - Move detailed historical context to brief footnotes
   - Update Current Focus to describe actual current work

4. **General Documentation Consistency** (30 min):
   - Scan all .md files for legacy patterns and outdated references
   - Update command examples to use make/uv consistently
   - Ensure configuration examples are current
   - Verify all referenced files exist

## Acceptance Criteria
- No "Legacy" or "Deprecated" sections remain in README
- architecture.md accurately reflects current structure
- backlog.md focuses on forward-looking tasks without historical confusion
- All documentation uses current commands and patterns
- Setup instructions validated as working

## Expected Outcomes
Unified, accurate documentation that confidently guides users through current system without legacy confusion
