**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 8-10 hours | **Priority**: P1 | **Impact**: Performance analytics and insights
**Dependencies**: Player data system (completed), Match history (completed) | **Strategic Value**: Data-driven decisions, engagement

## Problem Statement
Feature request from Dec 31, 2020, GitHub issue #40: Users need a dedicated statistics page to view comprehensive team and player performance metrics. Currently, statistics are scattered across different pages. A unified "Statistics" dashboard would allow users to:
- View all-time team scorers and top performers
- Track player match history and playing time
- Analyze team performance trends
- Identify performance gaps and opportunities
- Make data-driven decisions about training and tactics

## Implementation
1. **Player Statistics** (3-4 hours):
   - All-time goal scorers (top scorers list)
   - Most appearances/matches played per player
   - Career statistics per player (goals, assists, rating)
   - Player performance trends over time
   - Best performing players by position

2. **Team Statistics** (2-3 hours):
   - Total goals scored/conceded by season
   - Team win/loss/draw record
   - Home/away performance comparison
   - Average team rating trends
   - Match statistics (possession, shots, etc. if available from CHPP)

3. **Comparative Analysis** (2-3 hours):
   - Compare players by position and role
   - Position-specific statistics
   - Form trends (recent vs career)
   - Training effectiveness analysis
   - Player development trajectories

4. **UI & Visualization** (1-2 hours):
   - Charts showing performance trends
   - Sortable/filterable statistics tables
   - Period selection (season, all-time, custom range)
   - Export statistics capability
   - Mobile-responsive design

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dedicated statistics page accessible from team view
- All-time goal scorers ranked list
- Matches played per player statistics
- Team aggregate statistics
- Trend charts showing performance over time
- Filterable/sortable statistics tables
- Period selection (season, all-time, custom)
- Mobile-responsive design maintained
- Export statistics data (CSV/PDF optional)

## Data Sources
- Player career data from database (matches, goals, assists)
- Team match history for aggregate statistics
- Hattrick match data from CHPP for detailed match stats
- Player rating data over time

## Statistics to Display
- **Player Stats**: Goals, assists, appearances, minutes, avg rating, specialties
- **Team Stats**: Total goals, goals conceded, wins/losses/draws, seasons played
- **Top Performers**: Best scorers, most appearances, highest rated, best position fit
- **Trends**: Performance trajectory, training progress, form changes

## UI Layout
- Tab-based navigation: "Overall", "Players", "Teams", "Trends"
- Dashboard with key metrics cards at top
- Detailed statistics tables below
- Charts for trend visualization
- Filter/sort controls for customization

## Expected Outcomes
Better insight into team and player performance, data-driven decision making, improved user engagement
