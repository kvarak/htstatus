# [DOC-025] Update architecture.md File Structure

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 30 min | **Priority**: P6 | **Impact**: Architecture documentation accuracy
**Dependencies**: REFACTOR-007 (✅ completed) | **Strategic Value**: Accurate system documentation

## Problem Statement
architecture.md File Structure section (around line 130) still references old file organization:
- References to routes.py in file tree
- Missing app/constants.py in structure
- Blueprint organization may not reflect current state after REFACTOR-007

## Implementation
1. **Update File Tree** (15 min):
   - Remove routes.py from app/ directory listing
   - Add constants.py to app/ directory
   - Verify factory.py description matches current implementation
   - Update routes_bp.py description (maintained for compatibility)

2. **Verify Directory Structure** (10 min):
   - Compare documented structure with actual filesystem
   - Check all referenced files exist
   - Ensure descriptions match current functionality

3. **Add Brief Architecture Note** (5 min):
   - Add note about REFACTOR-007 completion (January 2026)
   - Brief mention of blueprint architecture completion
   - Link to progress.md or goals.md for detailed history

## Acceptance Criteria
- File structure matches actual filesystem
- All referenced files exist in codebase
- Blueprint architecture completion noted
- No references to removed routes.py

## Expected Outcomes
Accurate architecture documentation that matches current codebase structure
