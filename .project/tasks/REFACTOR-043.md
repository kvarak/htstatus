# REFACTOR-043: Consolidate Error Monitoring Infrastructure

## Problem Statement
INFRA-029 (Add Error Tracking and Monitoring Infrastructure) and FEAT-013 (Error Monitoring System) address the same infrastructure need and should be consolidated.

## Implementation
- Combine requirements from both tasks into unified monitoring solution
- Implement comprehensive error tracking and application monitoring
- Choose single monitoring stack (avoid over-engineering)
- Focus on actionable insights rather than data collection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unified error tracking and monitoring implementation
- [ ] Application health and performance metrics
- [ ] Alert mechanisms for critical issues
- [ ] Developer-friendly error reporting interface
- [ ] Production-ready monitoring infrastructure

## Priority
P3 - Infrastructure consolidation
