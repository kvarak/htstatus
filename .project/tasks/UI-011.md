# [UI-011] Core UI Guidelines Implementation

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 10-14 hours | **Priority**: P1 | **Impact**: Unified design system across Flask/React
**Dependencies**: None | **Strategic Value**: Consistent user experience, maintainable design system

## Problem Statement
Currently the UI lacks consistency between Flask templates and React components, with different styling approaches causing visual inconsistencies and maintenance burden. Need to implement unified design system across both frontend approaches.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Design System Foundation (3-4 hours) ✅ COMPLETE (January 28, 2026)
- ✅ Established unified color palette following football theme
- ✅ Defined typography scale and spacing system
- ✅ Created component library standards (.btn-primary-custom, .table-custom, .card-custom)
- ✅ Aligned CSS variables between Flask and React (HSL space-separated format)
- ✅ Added gradient and shadow variables matching React design system
- ✅ Created legacy aliases for backward compatibility
- ✅ Updated component classes to use new CSS variable format
- 📝 Documentation: Accessibility requirements pending Phase 4

**Technical Details**:
- CSS variables now use `--primary`, `--success`, `--warning`, etc. (no `color-` prefix)
- HSL format: `120 45% 25%` (space-separated, no `hsl()` wrapper in variable definitions)
- Component usage: `background-color: hsl(var(--primary))` for proper color application
- Legacy support: `--color-primary: hsl(120, 45%, 25%)` aliases maintained during migration

### Phase 2: Flask Template Implementation (3-4 hours) ✅ COMPLETE (January 28, 2026)
- ✅ Applied .btn-primary-custom class to login and matches buttons
- ✅ Applied .table-custom class to all major tables (player, training, matches, stats, debug)
- ✅ Optimized table design: compact spacing (4px/8px padding), smaller font (12px), tight line-height
- ✅ Fixed table header height for rotated column titles (5rem height with proper vertical alignment)
- ✅ Tested across different pages - responsive design maintained
- ✅ All templates using unified design tokens

**Templates Updated**:
- player.html: Main player list table + individual player skill tables
- training.html: Training history table
- matches.html: Match list table + match detail tables + action button
- stats.html: Stats per skill table + top scorers table + top performers table
- debug.html: Activity table
- login.html: Login button

### Phase 3: React Component Implementation (3-4 hours) 🎯 READY
- Update React components to use TailwindCSS utilities consistently
- Apply design system to existing Button/Table/Card components
- Ensure component props follow design system
- Implement responsive behavior

### Phase 4: Cross-Framework Validation (1-2 hours)
- Visual comparison between Flask and React versions
- Accessibility testing and WCAG compliance
- Performance impact assessment
- Documentation updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unified visual appearance between Flask and React
- All components follow football green theme
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- No performance regressions
- Comprehensive design system documentation
- Zero visual inconsistencies between frameworks

## Expected Outcomes
Consistent user experience, reduced design maintenance burden, scalable design system for future development, improved accessibility
