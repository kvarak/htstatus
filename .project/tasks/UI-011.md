# [UI-011] Core UI Guidelines Implementation

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 10-14 hours | **Priority**: P1 | **Impact**: Unified design system across Flask/React
**Dependencies**: None | **Strategic Value**: Consistent user experience, maintainable design system

## Problem Statement
Currently the UI lacks consistency between Flask templates and React components, with different styling approaches causing visual inconsistencies and maintenance burden. Need to implement unified design system across both frontend approaches.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Design System Foundation (3-4 hours)
- Establish unified color palette following football theme
- Define typography scale and spacing system
- Create component library standards
- Document accessibility requirements

### Phase 2: Flask Template Implementation (3-4 hours)
- Apply .btn-primary-custom, .table-custom, .card-custom classes
- Update all Flask templates to use unified design tokens
- Ensure responsive design patterns
- Test across different screen sizes

### Phase 3: React Component Implementation (3-4 hours)
- Update React components to use TailwindCSS utilities consistently
- Apply design system to existing Button/Table/Card components
- Ensure component props follow design system
- Implement responsive behavior

### Phase 4: Cross-Framework Validation (1-2 hours)
- Visual comparison between Flask and React versions
- Accessibility testing and WCAG compliance
- Performance impact assessment
- Documentation updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unified visual appearance between Flask and React
- All components follow football green theme
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- No performance regressions
- Comprehensive design system documentation
- Zero visual inconsistencies between frameworks

## Expected Outcomes
Consistent user experience, reduced design maintenance burden, scalable design system for future development, improved accessibility
