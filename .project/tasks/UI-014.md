# [UI-014] Add Dark Mode Support

**Status**: 🔮 Future | **Effort**: 6-8 hours | **Priority**: P4 | **Impact**: User preference and accessibility
**Dependencies**: UI design system (completed) | **Strategic Value**: User satisfaction, modern UX expectations

## Problem Statement
Modern web applications increasingly offer dark mode as a standard feature to:
- Reduce eye strain during extended usage sessions
- Improve accessibility for users with visual sensitivities
- Provide user choice and personalization options
- Match system preferences for better integration
- Reduce battery usage on mobile devices with OLED screens

Currently, the application only supports light mode, which may cause discomfort for users who prefer dark interfaces or use the application in low-light environments.

## Implementation
1. **Design System Extension** (2-3 hours):
   - Extend existing color system with dark mode variants
   - Maintain football green theme in dark mode palette
   - Ensure adequate contrast ratios for accessibility
   - Create dark mode versions of all UI components

2. **Theme Switching Infrastructure** (2-3 hours):
   - Implement theme detection and storage (localStorage/preferences)
   - Add theme toggle component for user control
   - Support system preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
   - Ensure theme persistence across sessions

3. **Dark Mode Implementation** (2 hours):
   - Apply dark mode styles to Flask templates with CSS custom properties
   - Implement JavaScript-based theme switching
   - Ensure consistent appearance across all pages
   - Update chart.js themes for dark mode compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- Seamless theme switching without page reload
- All UI components work properly in both light and dark modes
- Theme preference persists across browser sessions
- System theme preference automatically detected on first visit
- Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards in both modes
- Charts and visualizations adapt appropriately to theme

## Dark Mode Color System
- **Background**: Deep dark with subtle green undertones
- **Surfaces**: Layered grays with proper elevation
- **Primary**: Football green adjusted for dark backgrounds
- **Text**: High contrast whites and grays
- **Borders**: Subtle dividers that work in dark contexts

## Technical Implementation
- CSS custom properties for theme variables
- CSS custom properties for Flask templates
- LocalStorage for theme preference persistence
- System preference detection with matchMedia API
- Consistent theme application across Flask templates

## User Experience
- Theme toggle easily accessible in navigation
- Smooth transitions between light and dark modes
- Visual feedback for current theme state
- Respect system preferences by default
- Theme choice remembered across sessions and devices

## Expected Outcomes
Improved user satisfaction, better accessibility, modern user experience, reduced eye strain, increased user engagement during extended sessions
