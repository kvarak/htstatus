# [UI-015] Create Modular Chart Component System

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 50 min | **Priority**: P2 | **Impact**: Code maintainability
**Dependencies**: None | **Strategic Value**: Prevent repetitive chart cleanup work

## Problem Statement
Current chart implementations are hardcoded throughout templates (stats.html, training.html), leading to:
- Repetitive cleanup when removing chart types (recent leadership chart removal)
- Duplicated Chart.js configuration code
- Difficulty in maintaining consistent chart styling
- No reusable chart components for future features

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `/app/static/js/chart-components.js` with modular chart system
2. Define reusable chart configuration patterns: `createBarChart()`, `createLineChart()`, `createPieChart()`
3. Standardize chart theming with CSS variables for consistent colors
4. Refactor existing charts in stats.html and training.html to use modular system
5. Create chart enable/disable mechanism for user preferences

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing charts use modular chart component functions
- [ ] New chart types can be added with single function call
- [ ] Chart styling is consistent across all pages
- [ ] Chart removal requires only configuration change, no template editing
- [ ] Documentation for chart component usage patterns

## Strategic Benefits
- Eliminates future chart cleanup work
- Enables rapid chart feature development
- Provides foundation for user chart preferences
- Reduces code duplication and maintenance burden
