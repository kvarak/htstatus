# [BUG-009] Fix Player Changes Calculation Error

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 1-2 hours | **Priority**: P0 | **Impact**: Home page functionality
**Dependencies**: None | **Strategic Value**: Core functionality restoration

## Problem Statement
Error `[main.py] Error calculating player changes: list index out of range` occurs when displaying the home page, preventing player skill change timeline from displaying correctly.

## Error Context
- Occurs in main.py when trying to calculate player changes for display
- Related to accessing list indices that may not exist
- Likely caused by changes in data structure or API response format
- May be related to how player data or team names are stored/accessed

## Root Cause Investigation
The error suggests that code is trying to access a list index that doesn't exist, possibly:
1. Accessing team names by index when list is empty or shorter than expected
2. Player data structure changes affecting list access patterns
3. Session data structure inconsistencies after API changes

## Implementation
1. **Locate the specific code in main.py that calculates player changes** (30 min)
2. **Add bounds checking before accessing list indices** (30 min)
3. **Verify data structure assumptions are still valid** (15 min)
4. **Handle edge cases (empty lists, None values)** (15 min)
5. **Test with various player data scenarios** (15 min)

## Acceptance Criteria
- No errors in logs when loading home page
- Player change timeline displays correctly
- All player statistics and changes show properly
- Handles edge cases gracefully (no players, new users, etc.)

## Expected Outcomes
Restored home page functionality, reliable player change calculation
