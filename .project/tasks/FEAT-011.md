# [FEAT-011] Training Camp Planner

**Status**: 🔮 Future | **Effort**: 15-20 hours | **Priority**: P4 | **Impact**: Long-term player development optimization
**Dependencies**: Player statistics (completed), training recommendations (FEAT-006) | **Strategic Value**: Strategic planning, player development

## Problem Statement
Hattrick managers need to plan training camps effectively to:
- Maximize skill improvements for targeted players
- Coordinate training with match schedules and player availability
- Balance different training types across the season
- Optimize training efficiency and player development timing

Training camps are expensive but powerful tools in Hattrick that require careful planning to maximize value. Currently, users must manually plan training camps without systematic support for optimization and scheduling.

## Implementation
1. **Training Camp Database** (3-4 hours):
   - Model training camp types and their effects
   - Store training camp schedules and results
   - Track player participation and skill gains
   - Maintain training camp cost and effectiveness data

2. **Planning Interface** (4-6 hours):
   - Calendar view for scheduling training camps
   - Player selection with skill gap analysis
   - Training type recommendation based on team needs
   - Cost-benefit analysis for different training options

3. **Optimization Engine** (4-6 hours):
   - Algorithm to suggest optimal training camp timing
   - Player grouping for maximum training efficiency
   - Conflict detection with match schedules
   - ROI calculations for different training investments

4. **Progress Tracking** (2-3 hours):
   - Monitor training camp effectiveness over time
   - Compare actual vs predicted skill gains
   - Adjust recommendations based on historical results
   - Export training plans and schedules

5. **Integration & UI** (2-3 hours):
   - Integrate with existing player development features
   - Mobile-responsive planning interface
   - Calendar integration for scheduling
   - Sharing and collaboration features for training coordination

## Acceptance Criteria
- Training camps can be planned and scheduled effectively
- Player selection optimized for training camp effectiveness
- Cost-benefit analysis guides training investment decisions
- Progress tracking validates training camp value
- Integration with existing player development workflow
- Mobile-friendly interface for planning on the go

## Training Camp Features
- **Scheduling**: Calendar-based planning with conflict detection
- **Player Selection**: Skill gap analysis and grouping optimization
- **Cost Analysis**: ROI calculations and budget planning
- **Progress Tracking**: Effectiveness monitoring and adjustment
- **Recommendations**: AI-suggested optimal training strategies

## Data Analysis
- Historical training camp effectiveness rates
- Player skill improvement patterns by training type
- Cost per skill point gained analysis
- Optimal timing analysis based on match schedules
- Team composition impact on training effectiveness

## Expected Outcomes
Optimized player development, better training investment decisions, improved coordination of training activities, higher training efficiency, strategic advantage through systematic planning
