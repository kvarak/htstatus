# DOC-032: Consolidate and Reduce Documentation Overhead

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 3-4 hours | **Priority**: P3 | **Impact**: Maintenance burden reduction
**Dependencies**: None | **Strategic Value**: Sustainable hobby project documentation

## Problem Statement
The repository contains 66 markdown files creating excessive maintenance overhead for a hobby project. Key issues:
- Overlapping setup instructions across README.md, TECHNICAL.md, and DEPLOYMENT.md
- Extensive release documentation (RELEASES.md, RELEASES-INTERNAL.md) inappropriate for hobby scale
- Multiple README files with overlapping content across subdirectories
- Maintenance burden exceeds hobby project capacity

**Note**: docs/chpp/ contains official Hattrick CHPP reference documentation that should be preserved as valuable reference material.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Setup Documentation Consolidation (2 hours)
- Merge overlapping setup instructions from TECHNICAL.md and DEPLOYMENT.md into README.md
- Remove enterprise deployment patterns from all documentation
- Simplify to single "Quick Start" section in README.md
- Archive detailed technical documentation that exceeds hobby scope

### Phase 2: Subdirectory Documentation Cleanup (1 hour)
- Consolidate overlapping README.md files in scripts/, configs/, and other subdirectories
- Merge essential information into main documentation or remove redundant content
- Keep docs/chpp/ directory intact as official CHPP reference documentation
- Ensure remaining README files serve distinct, non-overlapping purposes

### Phase 3: Release Documentation Simplification (1 hour)
- Consolidate RELEASES.md and RELEASES-INTERNAL.md into single CHANGELOG.md entries
- Remove enterprise release process documentation
- Keep simple version history in CHANGELOG.md only
- Remove internal release management complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documentation files reduced from 66 to <40 through consolidation (preserving docs/chpp/ reference)
- [ ] Single authoritative setup guide in README.md
- [ ] docs/chpp/ preserved as valuable CHPP reference documentation
- [ ] Release documentation limited to CHANGELOG.md entries
- [ ] All remaining documentation serves hobby project maintenance needs
- [ ] No broken internal links after consolidation

## Strategic Value
Reduces documentation maintenance from enterprise-level to hobby-sustainable while preserving essential setup and usage information.
