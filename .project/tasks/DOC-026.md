# [DOC-026] Clean backlog.md Historical References

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 30 min | **Priority**: P6 | **Impact**: Documentation clarity
**Dependencies**: REFACTOR-007 (✅ completed) | **Strategic Value**: Remove confusing historical context

## Problem Statement
backlog.md contains scattered references to resolved historical issues (BUG-001, route conflicts) that confuse current development focus:
- Line 206: Reference to `app_with_routes` fixture timing/ordering conflicts
- Lines 1916-1919: Multiple references to "dual registration", "blueprint stubs", "route conflicts"
- Line 1941: Repeated references to resolved architectural issues
- These describe historical debugging context, not current development concerns

**Current Impact**:
- Developers reading backlog get confused about current system state
- Historical troubleshooting notes appear as active concerns
- Documentation reads as "still migrating" when migration is complete
- Obscures actual current priorities

## Implementation
1. **Mark Historical Context** (15 min):
   - Add "Historical Note:" prefix to lines referencing BUG-001 resolution
   - Move detailed historical context to brief footnotes
   - Consider moving extensive history to .project/history/ with reference links

2. **Update Current Focus Section** (10 min):
   - Ensure Current Focus describes actual current work
   - Remove any references to "dual registration" or "route conflicts"
   - Focus on forward-looking tasks (BUG-002/003/004, CLEANUP-001)

3. **Clean Task Descriptions** (5 min):
   - Review all P0-P3 task descriptions
   - Remove historical troubleshooting references
   - Keep focus on "what to do" not "what was wrong"

## Acceptance Criteria
- No references to "dual registration" or "route conflicts" as current issues
- Historical context clearly marked as past resolution, not current concern
- Current Focus section describes forward-looking work only
- Task descriptions focus on implementation, not historical debugging

## Expected Outcomes
Clear backlog that focuses on current and future work without confusing historical debugging notes
