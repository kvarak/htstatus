# [DOC-021] New Player Tutorial

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Execute | **Effort**: 3-5 hours | **Priority**: P1 | **Impact**: User onboarding and feature discovery
**Dependencies**: Core UI features (completed) | **Strategic Value**: Reduced learning curve, improved user retention

## Problem Statement
New players need guided onboarding to understand HT Status features and workflows. Returning players also benefit from tutorials about newly added features. Currently, users must explore the interface without guidance, leading to:
- Longer initial learning curve
- Missed features and capabilities
- Support questions about basic functionality
- Reduced feature adoption for advanced capabilities

## Implementation
1. **Interactive Tutorial Walkthrough** (1.5-2 hours):
   - Create step-by-step guided tour of main features
   - Highlight key pages: Team, Players, Training, Matches, Settings
   - Add tooltips and highlights for UI elements
   - Implement "skip" and "restart" functionality
   - Persist tutorial completion state per user

2. **Feature-Specific Guides** (1-1.5 hours):
   - Player group management (just added as FEAT-006)
   - Training data tracking and interpretation
   - Match analysis features
   - Settings customization options
   - Data update and synchronization

3. **What's New Alerts** (0.5-1 hour):
   - Detect new features since user last login
   - Display contextual "New Feature" badges
   - Link to relevant tutorial sections for new features
   - Allow dismissal and "show later" options

4. **Tutorial Content** (1-1.5 hours):
   - Write clear, concise instructional text
   - Create or capture screenshots
   - Document common workflows
   - Include Hattrick-specific terminology explanations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Interactive tutorial available on first login or from help menu
- All major features have tutorial coverage
- Users can restart or skip tutorial anytime
- New feature alerts display appropriately
- Tutorial state persists across sessions
- Tutorial content is clear and actionable
- Mobile-responsive tutorial experience
- Tutorial works in multiple supported languages (if FEAT-004 completed)

## Scope
- **Includes**: Guided tour, feature explanations, new feature alerts, contextual help
- **Excludes**: Hattrick game rules education (out of scope), advanced strategy guides
- **Focus**: HT Status feature functionality and workflows

## Technical Approach
- Use a tutorial library (e.g., Intro.js, Shepherd.js, or custom implementation)
- Store tutorial state in user settings/preferences
- Implement feature detection for new alerts
- Create reusable tutorial component/system for future features

## Expected Outcomes
Improved user onboarding, faster time-to-productivity, reduced support burden, better adoption of newly added features, increased user retention
