# Plan

## Quick Navigation
🔗 **Project Documentation**: [Architecture](architecture.md) • [Progress](progress.md) • [Goals](goals.md) • [Backlog](backlog.md)
🚀 **Development**: [Prompts](prompts.json) • [Technical Docs](../TECHNICAL.md) • [README](../README.md)

## Project Requirements

### Goals
- **goals.md**: Strategic vision and objectives - keep up to date

### Core Quality Standards
- **Testing Gate**: Verify changes with tests before completion (if tests are present)
- **Code Quality Gate**: Run linter and address critical issues (if linter is present)
- **Python Environment**: Always use `uv run python` instead of direct python calls to ensure correct environment

### Documentation Standards
- **architecture.md**: Update with structural changes
- **plan.md**: Mark completed items and update status
- **backlog.md**: Update with new tasks and milestones
- **progress.md**: Update with accomplishments and next steps
- **README.md**: User-focused setup and usage guide
- **TECHNICAL.md**: Technical architecture and implementation details
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Notable changes, new features, bug fixes

### File Structure Standards
- **Development files**: All meta-structure in `.project/`
- **Historical documentation**: Implementation guides, bug reviews, and retrospectives in `.project/history/`
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between backend, frontend, and documentation

### Security & Maintenance Standards
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit sensitive data; use environment variables or config files

## Future Opportunities
