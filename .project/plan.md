- **Code Quality Gate**: Run linter and address critical issues (if linter is present)

### Documentation Standards
- **architecture.md**: Update with structural changes
- **plan.md**: Mark completed items and update status
- **backlog.md**: Update with new tasks and milestones
- **progress.md**: Update with accomplishments and next steps
- **README.md**: User-focused setup and usage guide
- **TECHNICAL.md**: Technical architecture and implementation details
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Notable changes, new features, bug fixes

### File Structure Standards
- **Development files**: All meta-structure in `.project/`
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between backend, frontend, and documentation

### Security & Maintenance Standards
