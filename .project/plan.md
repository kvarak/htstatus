- **Python Environment**: Always use `uv run python` instead of direct python calls to ensure correct environment

### Documentation Standards
- **architecture.md**: Update with structural changes
- **plan.md**: Mark completed items and update status
- **backlog.md**: Update with new tasks and milestones
- **progress.md**: Update with accomplishments and next steps
- **README.md**: User-focused setup and usage guide
- **TECHNICAL.md**: Technical architecture and implementation details
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Notable changes, new features, bug fixes

### File Structure Standards
- **Development files**: All meta-structure in `.project/`
- **Historical documentation**: Implementation guides, bug reviews, and retrospectives in `.project/history/`
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between backend, frontend, and documentation

### Security & Maintenance Standards
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit sensitive data; use environment variables or config files

## Future Opportunities

*This section contains high-level suggestions generated by the 'look-outside-the-box' prompt. These are potential opportunities for consideration but are not part of the active plan until moved to the backlog.*

### � Real-Time Tactical Intelligence Platform
**Vision**: Transform HTStatus into live match analysis tool with predictive formation optimization and opponent scouting integration during actual Hattrick matches.
**Value**: First-mover advantage in live Hattrick analysis; premium insights monetization; viral growth through competitive intelligence.
**Foundation**: PWA enables real-time updates; existing match data model extends to live analysis; React dashboard ready for real-time visualizations.

### 📱 Hattrick Community Network Hub
**Vision**: Extend beyond individual teams to interconnected platform for leagues, alliances, transfer markets, and social collaboration.
**Value**: Network effects create user retention; league analytics enable B2B opportunities; social features drive viral engagement.
**Foundation**: Multi-team architecture naturally extends to leagues; OAuth supports federated authentication; PostgreSQL scales to community data.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Training Optimization Engine
**Vision**: Machine learning on historical skill progression data to predict optimal training schedules and player development trajectories.
**Value**: Predictable revenue through AI insights; differentiation via data science; potential expansion to other football management games.
**Foundation**: Time-series player data provides ML training datasets; skill calculation algorithms as feature engineering base; React dashboard for ML insights.

### 🌐 Cross-Platform Hattrick Ecosystem Integration
**Vision**: HTStatus as central hub connecting multiple Hattrick tools, forums, and community platforms through standardized APIs.
**Value**: Platform lock-in through ecosystem orchestration; API monetization; community tool consolidation market opportunity.
**Foundation**: CHPP integration experience; OAuth architecture; existing Flask API endpoints ready for external consumption.

### 📊 Advanced Performance Analytics & Benchmarking
**Vision**: Sophisticated performance prediction, peer benchmarking, and tactical analysis beyond current skill tracking capabilities.
**Value**: Premium analytics subscriptions; competitive intelligence services; data-driven coaching insights.
**Foundation**: Rich historical match and player data; existing performance calculations; React visualization framework ready for advanced charts.

## New Opportunities (January 21, 2026)

*These opportunities emerged from contrarian thinking and interface/business model innovation, complementing the existing feature-expansion suggestions above.*

### 🎯 Voice-First Tactical Assistant
**Vision**: Transform HTStatus into a voice-controlled coaching companion. Managers dictate observations while watching matches, ask questions during commutes, receive audio summaries on demand. "Siri for Hattrick team management" - mobile-first through voice, not dashboards.
**Why Novel**: Inverts interface paradigm - voice input/output primary, visuals secondary. Targets actual user behavior (mobile multitasking) not assumed behavior (desktop analytics). No Hattrick tool offers voice interface.
**Value**: Accessibility revolution (blind managers), true mobile-native experience, time efficiency (insights while driving/cooking), lower barrier (speaking faster than clicking), first-mover advantage in voice UI.
**Foundation**: PWA already built (service worker, offline), `create_page` utility for conversational templates, PostgreSQL queries ready for natural language translation, React can add voice components without touching Flask backend.
**Implementation**: Speech-to-text (Whisper/Web Speech API), RAG over player/match database, text-to-speech summaries, lightweight voice transcript UI, 3-4 month MVP timeline.

### 🔧 Developer API Marketplace - "Stripe for Hattrick Data"
**Vision**: Open HTStatus's data infrastructure as premium API service for third-party developers. Instead of competing with community tools, become the infrastructure provider. Developers pay per API call for normalized, historical, enriched player/match data.
**Why Novel**: Makes HTStatus a B2B platform, not just B2C tool. Turns competitors into customers. Creates platform moat through network effects (more devs → more data → more value). Revenue without building every requested feature.
**Value**: Recurring API billing, developer ecosystem acceleration, API lock-in switching costs, data quality validation from multiple consumers, positions HTStatus as Hattrick data infrastructure standard.
**Foundation**: Blueprint architecture perfect for API routes, SQLAlchemy models define schema, OAuth extends to API keys, PostgreSQL scales to API workload, type sync enables TypeScript SDK generation, 198/218 tests validate reliability.
**Implementation**: RESTful API + GraphQL layer, API key auth, rate limiting, Stripe integration, Swagger docs, webhook system. Tiers: Hobbyist $9/mo (10K calls), Developer $49/mo (100K), Business $249/mo (1M), Enterprise custom. 2-3 month MVP timeline.
**Strategic Priority**: Recommended first - lowest behavior change, creates moat, generates revenue, complements existing roadmap.

### 🔄 Collaborative League Intelligence
**Vision**: Transform from single-team tool to league-wide collaborative platform. Allied managers pool scouting data, share opponent insights, collectively analyze tactical trends. "Notion for football leagues" - multiplayer by default, focused on trust-based cooperatives (your league, your alliance).
**Why Novel**: Laser-focused on small cooperatives vs broad social network. Inverts competitive assumption - in Hattrick, league domination through collective intelligence matters more than random competition. Creates natural viral loop: one manager → entire league adopts.
**Value**: Network effects (new manager increases collective value), viral growth (1 user → 10-15 league members), high retention (league depends on you), no competitor offers true multiplayer collaboration, natural free→paid upsell path.
**Foundation**: Multi-team architecture extends to multi-manager leagues, PostgreSQL foreign keys support league model, blueprints allow `leagues_bp` without touching existing code, OAuth for secure invites, React components reusable for league dashboards.
**Implementation**: League workspace model (new `League` table), invite system (email/code links), shared opponent scouting database, collaborative discussions, privacy controls, league-wide analytics dashboards. Pricing: Solo free, League $4.99/manager/mo (≤15), volume discounts for larger. 4-6 month MVP timeline.
