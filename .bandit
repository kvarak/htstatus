# Bandit security configuration for HTStatus
# https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

# Skip specific security checks with documented rationale:
# B404: subprocess module import - Used only for git version detection (static commands)
# B607: Starting process with partial executable path - Git command is hardcoded
# B603: subprocess call without shell=True - No shell needed for static commands
#
# Security rationale: Git version detection is a development/operations utility
# with no user input injection vectors. See inline documentation in app/routes.py
# and app/routes_bp.py for detailed security context.
