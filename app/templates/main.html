              The whole website is under development and will change continuously. Sometimes you'll be logged off and need to re-login (give permission again),
              but you'll probably not loose any data.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              You're here, so you probably want to help out. If you can't get access to the tool (the login doesn't work),
              you most likely haven't been added as a betatester in Hattrick. This is only a problem while the application is "Under development"
              and will not be needed when released. You can <a href="https://github.com/kvarak/htstatus/issues/new/choose">request access as a beta tester</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              If you have access and are able to login, please help out by <a href="https://github.com/kvarak/htstatus/issues">reporting bugs and suggesting features</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              If you are savvy in the land of python/flask/postgres, and can't stay out of helping with the development, don't hesitate to suggest pull requests to the public repo.
              I'm not, so this is definitely a learning experience for me and all help is appreciated.
